# Motivation:
The current COVID-19 pandemic is showing negative effects on human health as well as on social and economic life. It is a critical and challenging task to revive public life while minimizing the risk of infection. Reducing interactions between people by social distancing is an effective and prevalent measure to reduce the risk of infection and spread of the virus within a community. And so, this project will help to monitor that.

# YOLO Theory:
You Only Look Once (YOLO) is an algorithm that uses neural networks to provide real-time object detection. Object detection in YOLO is done as a regression problem and provides the class probabilities of the detected images. As the name suggests, the algorithm requires only a single forward propagation through a neural network to detect objects.
